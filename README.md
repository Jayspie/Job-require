# Job Require

Find the popular requirements for the careers or jobs you are looking for. 

Job Require will be a website that scrapes through popular job-searching websites such as LinkedIn, Indeed, ZipRecruiter, and others; to get the popular or most common job requirements. The website will display the findings in a graph and list them for the viewer. The website will also provide links to resources for the viewer to gain those skills and requirements.
